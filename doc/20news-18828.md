# The 20 Newsgroups data set

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly 
across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his 
Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups 
collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as 
text classification and text clustering.
